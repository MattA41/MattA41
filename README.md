## My Name is Matt, I'm a student at Eastern Washington University getting a degree in Computer Science and a minor in computer science

### About me
I have been interested in computers for a long time. In high school, I took game design, computer science, and computer repair classes. I am passionate about computers and love working with them.

These Git hub repos are a few of my school projects. I am saving a few of them to document what I have learned and what kind of programs I have created.
