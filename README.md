## My Name is Matt. I'm a recent graduate of Eastern Washington University, holding a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Cybersecurity. I am currently looking for my first job in the industry

### About me
I have been interested in computers for a long time. During my studies, I took courses in game design, web development, and cybersecurity, and I worked as an IT specialist for the school. I am passionate about computers and love working with them.

These Git hub repos are a few of my school projects. I am saving a few of them to document what I have learned and what kind of programs I have created.
