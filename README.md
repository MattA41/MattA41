Hi I'm a student at Eastern Washington University working on getting a degree in Computer Science

### About me
I have been interested in computers for a long time. In high school, I took classes in game design, computer science, and computer repair. Working with computers is something I enjoy doing.
This Git hub is a few of my school projects. I am saving a few of them to document How I have learned and what kind of programs I have created.
